//! hackamore data plane — the reverse proxy that enforces policy decisions.
//!
//! - [`normalize`] turns an HTTP request into the engine's `Action` (the protocol
//!   adapter; generic by default, with per-service flavors).
//! - [`service`] is the configurable upstream allowlist and Host-based router.
//! - [`core`] is the transport-agnostic decision + enforcement path ([`Gateway`]).
//! - [`server`] is the axum HTTP surface and the streaming forwarder (HTTP + SSE).
